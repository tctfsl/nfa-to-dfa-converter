# nfa-to-dfa-converter
An assignment for Theory of Computation (TIC2151) subject.

## Background
The first part of the assignment was to create a converter from NFA (with ε) to DFA. The requirement of the assignment was either we implement the converter using HTML or Visual Basic. We chose the former since we're more familiar with it. We also used JavaScript for the interaction.

## Process Flow
The program can be split into 3 main parts:
1. Converting ε-NFA to NFA
2. Converting NFA to DFA
3. Minimising DFA

## Current Status
I handled the first and third part of the program while my other teammate, @MiguelOrino handled the second part. He also handled the integration part of the program.

## Improvement in the Pipeline
